1. Tobii Pro X3-120 shows pupil size every third sample.

The Tobii Pro X3-120 runs a fixed sequence of illumination:

Dark Pupil - Dark Pupil - Bright Pupil

The pupil size is slightly different from dark and bright pupil, and more respondents will give better results in bright pupil mode.

To avoid non-significant variations in the pupil size between the dark and bright pupil illumination modes, the Pro X3-120 output gives the pupil size only for the bright pupil sample (i.e. every third sample).
